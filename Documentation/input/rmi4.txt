RMI4 Touchscreen Driver
=======================

TBD

Firmware Update Function
========================

The RMI4 driver uses the kernel's request_firmware() feature to obtain
firmware for the touch sensor.  To enable this feature, you will need to
add the line
    CONFIG_RMI_FWLIB=y
to your defconfig file.  After doing so, you should invoke the commands
    make distclean
    make <your defconfig>
in order to activate this feature in the kernel.

The Synaptics sensor firmware needs to be placed in your kernel source tree in
the file firmware/rmi4/<productid>.img.ihex, where <productid> is the Product
ID found in the F01 query registers (F01_RMI_QUERY11 through F01_RMI_QUERY20).
See note below if for some reason a different .img file name is required.

To prepare Synaptics provided .img file for reflashing, convert it to .ihex
format using the following command:

    objcopy -I binary -O ihex <productid>.img firmware/rmi4/<productid>.img.ihex

Then make sure to add the image file name to the CONFIG_RMI4_FWLIB entry in the
firmware/Makefile (found in your kernel source tree).  If you don't do this,
the image file won't be included, and the firmware loader class will delay boot
processing for 60 seconds waiting for a non-existent userspace response to the
firmware load request.

If there is not already a CONFIG_RMI4_FWLIB entry in firmware/Makefile in your
kernel source tree, add one like this:

    fw-shipped-$(CONFIG_RMI4_FWLIB) += rmi4/<productid>.img

You will need to rebuild your kernel and install it on your device before the
updated firmware will be available.

Firmware updates for multichip solutions (aka LTS) are not supported.

Alternate .img file names
-------------------------

It is strongly recommended that you name your image file using the RMI4
Product ID as described above.  If for some reason the RMI4 Product ID is not
suitable for naming your .img file, you can use one of the following methods
to specify an alternate name:

* specify the image name in the platform data in your board file.  See the
firmware_name field of struct rmi_device_platform_data in rmi.h.

* specify the image name using the img_name module parameter at boot time.

* hack the file rmi_fw_update.c and hard code the value of the img_name
variable.  This is NOT RECOMMENDED, and may have unknown side effects.
