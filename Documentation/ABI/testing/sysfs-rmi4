Description:

  The RMI4 driver implementation exposes a set of informational and control
  parameters via sysfs.  These parameters are those that typically will be
  referenced and/or adjusted during normal operation of products containing
  RMI sensors.  For paramters that are only viewed or adjusted during product
  development and debug, please see debugfs-rmi4 in this directory.

  General parameters for a particular RMI4 sensor are found in
  /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensorXX/, where XX is a the device's ID as a two
  digit number (padded with leading zeros).  Function specific parameters
  for an RMI4 sensor are found in /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensorXX.fnYY/, where
  XX is a the device's ID as a two digit number (padded with leading zeros)
  and YY is the hexdecimal function number (for example, fn11 for RMI function
  F11).

  Many of the parameters exposed here are described in detail in the
  RMI4 Specification, which is found here:
    http://www.synaptics.com/sites/default/files/511-000136-01_revD.pdf
  For such parameters, we'll reference you to that document, rather than
  copying the contents here.

  /sys/bus/rmi/devices
      /sensorXX/
          bsr ... (rw) bus select register, if supported (see spec)
          enabled ... (rw) enable/disable interrupt management [deprecated]

      /sensor00.fn01/
          chargerinput ... (rw) User space programs can use this to tell the
                  sensor that the system is plugged into an external power
                  source (as opposed to running on batteries).  This allows
                  the sensor firmware to make necessary adjustments for the
                  current capacitence regime.  Write 1 to this when the
                  system is using external power, write 0 to this when the
                  system is running on batteries.  See spec for full details.
          configured ... (ro) Shows the current state of the configured bit.
                  This will be 1 most of the time (indicating the device has
                  been appropriately configured), but will switch to 0 briefly
                  if the sensor experiences a firmware or ASIC reset event.
                  See spec for full details.
          datecode ... (ro) The date on which the module was manufactured.
                  See spec for full details.
          doze_holdoff ... (rw) Controls how long the sensor will wait before
                  entering the doze state when no fingers are present on the
                  device. The time is in terms of 10 milliseconds - a
                  doze_holdoff value of 3 corresponds to a time period of 30
                  milliseconds.  See spec for full details.
          flashprog ... (ro) Defines the current device operating mode. The
                  flashprog flag is set if the normal operation of the device
                  is suspended because the device is in a flash programming
                  enabled state.  See spec for full details.
          interrupt_enable ... (ro) This represents the current RMI4 interrupt
                  mask (F01_RMI_Ctrl1 registers).  See spec for full details.
          manufacturer ... (ro) This is the identity of the manufacturer of
                  the device, as obtained from F01_RMI_Query0.  See spec for
                  full details.
          nosleep ... (rw) Writing 1 to this parameter disables all normal
                  firmware powersaving behaviors and forces the device to run
                  at full power without sleeping.  See spec for full details.
          productid ... (ro) The product info bytes, as determined from
                  F01_RMI_Query2 and F01_RMI_Query3 registers.  See spec for
                  full details.
          productinfo ... (ro) A string of up to 10 characters, identifying
                  the product.  See spec for full details.
          reportrate ... (rw) This is the current value of the RMI4 ReportRate
                  bit (F01_RMI_Ctrl0, bit 6).  The meaning of this bit is very
                  much device-dependent. Please see both the RMI4 spec and the
                  sensor spec sheet for details.
          reset ... (wo)  Writing a 1 to this write only register forces the
                  device to reset.
          sleepmode ... (rw) Controls power management on the device.  Writing
                  0 to this parameter puts the device into its normal operating
                  mode.  Writing 1 to this parameter fully disables touch
                  sensors and similar inputs - no touch data will be reported
                  from the device in this mode.  Writing 2 or 3 to this device
                  may or may not have an effect, depending on the particular
                  device - see the product specification for your sensor for
                  details.
          statuscode ... (ro) Reports the most recent device status, such as
                  invalid configuration, device reset, CRC failure, and so on.
                  Please se the RMI4 specification for details.
          unconfigured ... (ro) This is the opposite of the configured bit,
                  described above.
          wakeup_threshold ... (rw) This controls the change in capacitive
                  signal needed to wake the device from the doze state.  Please
                  see the RMI4 specification for the F01_RMI_Ctrl3 register
                  for more details.

      /sensor00.fn11/
          abs_pos_filt ... (rw) Enables or disables the absolute position
                  filter feature.  See spec for full details.
          maxPos ... (rw) Adjusts the  maximum X and Y position control
                  registers (F11_2D_Ctrl6 through F11_2D_Ctrl9).  See spec for
                  full details.
          relreport ... (rw) Enables or disabled relative finger motion
                  reporting.  See spec for full details.
          rezero ... (wo) Force recalibration of the F11 2D sensor(s).  See
                  spec for full details.
