/**
 * @manufacturer_id - reports the identity of the manufacturer of the RMI
 * device. Synaptics RMI devices report a Manufacturer ID of $01.
 * @custom_map - at least one custom, non
 * RMI-compatible register exists in the register address map for this device.
 * @non-compliant - the device implements a register map that is not compliant
 * with the RMI specification.
 * @has_lts - the device uses Synaptics' LTS hardware architecture.
 * @has_sensor_id - the SensorID query register (F01_RMI_Query22) exists.
 * @has_charger_input - the ChargerConnected bit (F01_RMI_Ctrl0, bit 5) is
 * meaningful.
 * @has_adjustable_doze - the doze (power management) control registers exist.
 * @has_adjustable_doze_holdoff - the doze holdoff register exists.
 * @has_product_properties - indicates the presence of F01_RMI_Query42,
 * ProductProperties2.
 * @productinfo_1 - meaning varies from product to product, consult your
 * product spec sheet.
 * @productinfo_2 - meaning varies from product to product, consult your
 * product spec sheet.
 * @year - year of manufacture MOD 2000.
 * @month - month of manufacture
 * @day - day of manufacture
 * @wafer_id1_lsb - The wafer-lot ID registers record the lot number of the
 * wafer from which the module’s touch controller was produced.
 * @wafer_id1_msb - The wafer-lot ID registers record the lot number of the
 * wafer from which the module’s touch controller was produced.
 * @wafer_id2_lsb - The wafer-lot ID registers record the lot number of the
 * wafer from which the module’s touch controller was produced.
 * @wafer_id2_msb - The wafer-lot ID registers record the lot number of the
 * wafer from which the module’s touch controller was produced.
 * @wafer_id3_lsb - The wafer-lot ID registers record the lot number of the
 * wafer from which the module’s touch controller was produced.
